        <p>For a short and relatively easy day hike, it doesn’t get much better than a gently-sloping trail through old growth forest, a view over Snoqualmie Pass and the Southern Cascades, and a trailhead only 40 minutes east of Seattle. The hike starts off on the shores of Rattlesnake Lake and cuts through a series of switchbacks that rise 1,000 feet over 1.5 miles. The path is steadily uphill but never overly difficult, which means that the ledge is crowded on weekends and sunny summer days (it’s a great option for watching the sunset after work or as a trail run). Before or after the hike, the lake itself is a great place to relax, walk, swim, and fish. For tougher hikes near the city, popular Little Si and Mount Si (below) across the valley are similar but slightly more challenging.</p>
